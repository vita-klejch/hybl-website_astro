# MIKI HYBL - PORTFOLIO WEBSITE - 2nd version

A friend who is an excellent photographer and focuses on wedding photos needed to create a new website containing a sample of his work.
I designed a simple portfolio website for him using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. FormSubmit (available at https://formsubmit.co/) was used to send emails from the form.

First version is availible at https://vita-klejch.github.io/hybl-portfolio_website/

Second version looks almost same like the first one but it is build with different technologies - it is build with Astro, which is excelent microframework used mainly for Static Site Rendering (SSR)

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)
- JavaScript
